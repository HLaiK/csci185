    <p>Welcome to the second part of whatever this god forsaken joke of a website is. 
        lol.
        If you thought this actually provided some answers on to why I dislike those specific
        characters, get trolled.
        partically. 
        Not really?
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Mike is just a narcissist. </li>
        <li>Eleven got daddy problems. Literally.</li>
        <li>Nancy was just a shitty friend to Barb and she needs to choose who tf she wants.</li>
    </ul>
    
    Thats about it. 
    Thank you for coming to my Ted talk :) 
    Here's a gold star and a chocolate chip cookie for making it through.
