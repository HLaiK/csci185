Please answer the following accessibility questions:


1. What accessibility corrections did you have to make?
I had to add in the language at the beginning, as well as include the alt text to the photos and aira-label for the buttons. 

2. Do you think your website is usable if you turn off the CSS? Why or why not?
It would stil be usable without css becuase css is just to make the website styled and look good. 

3. Is your site is tabbable? In other words, without the use of the mouse, are all the links and buttons accessible using the tab key?
yes it's still tabbale
